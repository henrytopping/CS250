Understanding user needs and implementing them into a project involves active listening and comprehension of user feedback and requirements, then translating them into features and functionalities within the program. Creating user stories helps this process by outlining the user's perspective and needs in a simple manner to help the development team maintain a proper understanding of what the user wants.  

Approaching program development involves understanding the project requirements and translating them into manageable tasks to complete. Incorporating agile processes such as Scrum allows for a much more flexible process of development, accounting for adaptability to changes and the incorporation of feedback as the project continues. These methodologies can also yield better communication and productivity.  

In software development, being a good team member requires effective communication, collaboration, and willingness to share and adapt to changes that may occur throughout the production of a project. Also, respecting deadlines and contributing positively to the team's dynamics are essential to achieving success in the software development process.
